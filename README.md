# Resume

This repository allows me to manage ridiculous amounts of variations to my resume. I found myself making resumes for all different industries: engieering, software, resturaunts, oddjobs, fire & ems, and variations within these industries. Having a git branch for each industry with a subrepository housing all of my resume components allows me to build resumes faster and manage variations easier. My resume is now broken into building blocks that I can quickly assemble.

My resume uses LaTeX and more specifically requires compiling with LuaLatex.

Branches:

- Engineering
- Fire/EMS
  - USAJobs
- Oddjobs
